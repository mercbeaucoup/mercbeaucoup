### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ I was recently employed at Twitter, where I worked on front end web features. I loved my job, and was unfortunately affected by layoffs related to the merger. I'm now looking for my next adventure.
- ğŸ‘· I've been experimenting with Angular and brushing up on TypeScript, so I created a really simple to-do app.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m doing interview prep! I'm studying data structures and algorithms, brushing up on systems design, and practicing with vanilla JS.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for study buddies and accountability buddies. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how my leadership development skills and my former career in social work have helped me code.
