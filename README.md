### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I was recently employed at Twitter, where I worked on front end web features. I loved my job, and was unfortunately affected by recent layoffs related to the merger. I'm now looking for my next adventure.
- 🌱 I’m doing interview prep! I'm studying data structures and algorithms, brushing up on systems design, and practicing with vanilla JS.
- 👯 I’m looking for study buddies and accountability buddies. 
- 💬 Ask me about how my leadership development skills and my former career in social work have helped me code.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredith-cornelius/
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun facts: I am obsessed with whales. Especially blue whales. And I recently started volunteering to foster rescue dogs.
